#Overwiew 

Currently the market is flooded with human dating applications. The need for interpersonal relationships is not being met in the interspecies sector.
FaceBaKawk takes this concept, and amplifies it. What if, your chicken could be involved? What if your lonely chicken could find friends, go to events,
browse through the forums  or even...find chicken love! FaceBaKawk is an innovative website that connects users with their chickens lives. We 
promise an experience that will bring owners closer to their chickens, and chickens closer to their communities. FaceBaKawk - for those who dare to sqwak.

#Lessons Learned 

Putting everything together in a full stack application can be tricky. We feel as though we have been given many puzzles pieces, and now we were set loose to put them together.
Learning how important the back end is was quite interesting to me. The backend took several days, but the front took one. The importance of the backen can not be understated.
Learning how to work together as a team was very interesting to see working at full capacity. Communication was key when collaborating, that goes with the challenge of making sure our githubs were synced.  



For this projext we used excel, which is a database.
